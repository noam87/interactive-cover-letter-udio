## Wat

Small interactive cover letter I made one night when applying to my position at
[Udio Agricultural Technology](http://udio.ai).

**Backstory:** I hadn't used javascript in some time (over a year and a half)
and they were to bring me on to a node.js app. To demonstrate that I can work
with Javascript I built this quick single page app over the span of
a few hours.

This is also my first time using React. I had no patience to hunt for and
learn a new pagination library cause I had people over, so I rolled my own
event-based pagination scheme. It's ugly but it works.

## To Run

Just open the HTML file in your favorite browser.
